My old blog had been a bit neglected, especially since I did most of the software-related
posts on my [work blog](http://www.peerassembly.com/blog.html). That blog is probably
going to continue to get the majority of my blogging energy (such as it is) but I thought
it might be interesting to have a place to post about non-software that are interesting.

This kitten has absolutely nothing to do with the blog but I read somewhere that people
are 43.5% more likely to bookmark a site with a cute picture.
